    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      GENESIS is your gateway to a world of curated music playlists and emerging
      artists. We're a community-driven platform designed to help you discover

      Which music services does Genesis support?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Currently, we exclusively support music from Audius, a decentralized music
      platform. This allows us to offer GENESIS with minimal server fees,
      keeping the app accessible and sustainable. We have plans to integrate
      other music services in the future.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-center text-4xl font-black mt-8">
      How does GENESIS benefit from using Audius?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Audius's decentralized nature means we don't need extensive server
      infrastructure to host your playlists. This translates to lower operating
      costs, enabling us to focus on building a great app experience and
      supporting independent artists.

      Genesis leverages the decentralized nature of Audius to minimize server
      fees and keep the app sustainable. We currently host the app on free tiers
      of popular platforms like Render, Vercel, or Netlify, with plans to use
      Fleek.

      Genesis thrives on a balanced ecosystem that supports both creators and
      users:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-center" style="width: 50%">
      <li>
        Creator Subscriptions: Subscription fees from creators provide a
        consistent revenue stream that covers our operational costs, including
        hosting and development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marketplace Transactions: A portion of each marketplace transaction goes
        towards supporting Genesis. This ensures the platform can continue to
        grow and offer new features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Community Support: Your donations play a crucial role in helping us
        expand our services, integrate more music platforms, and build a
        thriving music community.
