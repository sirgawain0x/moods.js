    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      GENESIS is your gateway to a world of curated music playlists and emerging
      artists. We're a community-driven platform designed to help you discover
      fresh sounds and connect with passionate music curators.

      Which music services does Genesis support?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Currently, we exclusively support music from Audius, a decentralized music
      platform. This allows us to offer GENESIS with minimal server fees,
      keeping the app accessible and sustainable. We have plans to integrate
      other music services in the future.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-center text-4xl font-black mt-8">
      How does GENESIS benefit from using Audius?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Audius' decentralized nature means we don't need extensive server
      infrastructure to host your playlists. This translates to lower operating
      costs, enabling us to focus on building a great app experience and
      supporting independent artists.

    <h1 class="text-center text-6xl font-black mt-8">How does it work?</h1>
    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Genesis is designed to foster a vibrant music community where everyone
      benefits. Here's how it works: For Music Lovers: Explore curated
      playlists, discover new artists and genres, and connect with passionate
      music curators. Support your favorite creators by purchasing exclusive
      content in the marketplace. For Music Creators: Sign up for a creator
      subscription to submit your playlists and tracks. Earn revenue based on
      the traffic your content generates. Access analytics, promotional tools,
      and engage with your audience. Sell exclusive content in the marketplace.
      Our Technology: Genesis leverages the decentralized nature of Audius to
      minimize server fees and keep the app sustainable. We currently host the
      app on free tiers of popular platforms like Render, Vercel, or Netlify
      with plans to use Fleek.

    <p class="text-center mt-4" style="width: 50%">
      Genesis thrives on a balanced ecosystem that supports both creators and
      users: Creator Subscriptions: Subscription fees from creators provide a
      consistent revenue stream that covers our operational costs, including
      hosting and development. Marketplace Transactions: A portion of each
      marketplace transaction goes towards supporting Genesis. This ensures the
      platform can continue to grow and offer new features. Community Support:
      Your donations play a crucial role in helping us expand our services,
      integrate more music platforms, and build a thriving music community.
